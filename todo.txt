Stuff to do soon:

* finish lobster enemies
* destroy blocks with lasers OR ensure that levels generate with path from start to all important things
* figure out the final(?) name (___ superheavy industries)
* make system for new levels
* adjust palette?
* tame explosions
* rework enemy spawning/timers

Current known issues:

* stuff (maybe just polyps) spawns incorrectly after reset
* ui goes underneath other stuff after reset


DOPE IDEAS:

* enemy that bursts out of tiles

FOR FOUNDRY:

* big enemy that can't fit in the 1x1 crevices, but chases you/shoots spread in the open
* spelunky temple-cross-trap style enemy
* bomberman-bomb style trap
