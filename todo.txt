Planned for build v0.4.0

* final polish

Todo around build v1.0.0

Current known issues:

* exit text is gross
* start menu is a little gross (makes me nostalgic for engine001...)
* options menu gross as hail: (bad positioning for windowed, renders the player, doesn't render exit text)
* major fps issues
* hitting enter on options menu while selector is over "back" will start the game immediately
* double-energy-spawn issue (i think polyps are getting shot twice maybe)

DOPE IDEAS:

* enemy that bursts out of tiles
