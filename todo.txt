Stuff to do soon:

* make proper ui
* finish lobster enemies
* destroy blocks with lasers OR ensure that levels generate with path from start to all important things
* figure out the final(?) name (___ superheavy industries)
* make system for new levels
* adjust palette?
* finish exploders (particles, destruction of nearby tiles & sprites)


Current known issues:

* stuff (maybe just polyps_ spawns incorrectly after reset
* ui goes underneath other stuff after reset


DOPE IDEAS:

* enemy that bursts out of tiles
