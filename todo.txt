Stuff to do soon:

* make polyps tile-sized and match the new aethetic
* make proper ui
* make the levels generate better (including polyp spawns)


Current known issues:

* enemies don't get removed when they leave the boundaries
* polyps sometimes don't spawn on their designated tiles (only after respawning?)
