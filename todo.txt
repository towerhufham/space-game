Stuff to do soon:

* make proper ui
* finish lobster enemies
* destroy blocks with lasers OR ensure that levels generate with path from start to all important things
* figure out the final(?) name (___ superheavy industries)
* make system for new levels
* unify pelette (all bad stuff is red, all good stuff is blue, etc.)
* i frames
* finish exploders (particles, destruction of nearby tiles & sprites)


Current known issues:

* stuff (maybe just polyps_ spawns incorrectly after reset
