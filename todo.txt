Stuff for build v0.2.0

* background for map
* figure out why furnaces start exploded on spawn for first foundry gen

Stuff to do eventually:

* decide what to do with lobster enemies
* destroy blocks with lasers OR ensure that levels generate with path from start to all important things
* figure out the final(?) name (___ superheavy industries)

Current known issues:

* none not listed elsewhere in this file

DOPE IDEAS:

* enemy that bursts out of tiles

FOR FOUNDRY:

* big enemy that can't fit in the 1x1 crevices, but chases you/shoots spread in the open
* spelunky temple-cross-trap style enemy
* bomberman-bomb style trap
